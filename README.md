Blinkit Sales Performance Analysis Report 
This project analyzes Blinkit's sales data to uncover insights into product performance, customer preferences, and outlet efficiency. Key performance indicators such as Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items Sold, and Average Customer Rating were calculated using DAX in Power BI.

The data was first cleaned using Python (NumPy and Pandas) to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize inconsistent labels. After preprocessing, the data was visualized in Power BI using a variety of charts like donut charts, bar charts, stacked columns, and matrix cards to explore trends across item types, fat content, outlet size, and location.

Insights revealed that regular-fat items, older outlets, and medium-sized stores were top performers, guiding strategic decisions for marketing and inventory planning.
